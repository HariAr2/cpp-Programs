## 1. Getting Started

Before you start contributing, make sure you have:

- A GitHub account.
- A working knowledge of C++.
- Git installed on your local machine.

## 2. Coding Style

Consistent coding style is crucial for maintainability. Please adhere to the following guidelines:

- Use a consistent and readable coding style throughout the project.
- Follow a naming convention for variables, functions, classes, and files (e.g., camelCase or snake_case).
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Indentation should be with tabs or spaces (please specify in project-specific guidelines).
- Avoid excessive comments, but add comments when code is not self-explanatory.
- Use descriptive commit messages (see [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)).

## 3. Pull Request Process

To contribute code, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a new branch for your work: `git checkout -b your-branch-name`.
4. Make your code changes, following the coding style guidelines.
5. Test your changes thoroughly (see [Testing](#testing)).
6. Commit your changes using clear and descriptive commit messages.
7. Push your branch to your fork on GitHub: `git push origin your-branch-name`.
8. Create a pull request (PR) to the main repository's relevant branch.
9. Provide a clear and concise description of your changes in the PR.

## 4. Commit Message Guidelines

Write clear and informative commit messages following this format:

```
[Category]: Brief description of the change

Optional longer description if necessary.
```

Use the following categories in your commit messages:

- **Feature**: for new features or enhancements.
- **Fix**: for bug fixes.
- **Refactor**: for code refactoring.
- **Docs**: for documentation changes.
- **Test**: for adding or modifying tests.
- **Chore**: for routine tasks, build process, etc.

Example commit messages:

```
[Feature]: Add a new function to calculate Fibonacci sequence
```

```
[Fix]: Resolve segmentation fault issue in the search algorithm
```

## 5. Testing

Ensure your code is thoroughly tested before creating a pull request. Follow project-specific testing guidelines, and add tests for new features or bug fixes. Tests should pass before your PR is accepted.

## 6. Documentation

Keep the documentation up-to-date. If you introduce new features or change existing ones, update the project's documentation accordingly. Clear and informative documentation is essential for understanding the codebase.

## 7. Code Review

Be open to feedback during the code review process. Address comments and suggestions promptly. Code reviews help maintain code quality and consistency.

## 8. Contact

If you have questions or need assistance, feel free to contact the project maintainers via GitHub issues or other communication channels provided in the project's documentation.

Thank you for contributing to our C++ project! Your efforts are valuable in improving our codebase and making it more robust and efficient.
